# Learn Finnish

![Learn Finnish banner image](./Assets/banner-image.png)

This repository is a collection of my personal notes and learning resources that I've found helpful in my Finnish language learning journey.

I recommend using the Obsidian app (https://obsidian.md/) to open the Markdown files, as I used Obsidian to link my notes.

Feel free to explore and use these resources to support your own language learning!

If you have any questions or suggestions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to help and learn from others!
